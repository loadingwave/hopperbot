# Hopperbot
bc hopper takes something from one place to another
# Project Design
## Language
I kinda really want to do this in rust, bc I really like it, but it seems there is basically no support for this type of api for rust
I am using python, loads of libraries are already written for python, besides, Rust is more aimed at system level stuf, this isn't really that.
## Design
I want this to be datadriven:
I can put in a file with some people and their socialmedia handles and the program uses that to figure out what to update on

## Setup
I'm using [this](https://mitelman.engineering/blog/python-best-practice/automating-python-best-practices-for-a-new-project/) setup right now. Really quite usefull :]

### Setup selenium
Imports like selenium are automatically handled with this, however to use selenium we do need to install geckodriver and make sure firefox is intalled [src]:

(https://askubuntu.com/questions/870530/how-to-install-geckodriver-in-ubuntu) get the link for the latest release at the [relase page](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). (at time of writing this is https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.31.0/geckodriver-v0.31.0-linux64.tar.gz)
```
wget <link to release>
tar -xvzf <tarbal you just downloaded>
chmod +x geckodriver
sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/
```
I also had to install firefox: `sudo apt install firefox`

## Posting Images to tumblr
~~This seems harder than it should be. There does not seem to be a way to do this automatically with pytumblr Ã³r pytumblr2.~~

~~From the tumblr api i gathered i need to do this as a multipart-encoded thing. I can do this with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file)~~

~~[Decode an Image](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#binary-response-content)~~

I had to read the documentation for pytumblr2 better (whoops). Why is all python documentation inline??

## Reblogs
I want to do that cool thing where update accounts will reblog and say "Ranboo replied to Tommy"
To do this I will need to store a list of (twitter) id's and link them to tumblr reblog id's.
I think I will also need to store the blog/person this is for, just so that I can have the correct name in the text

It seems sqlite is by far the easiest as it is build in to python

# Twitter

## Screenshots
- Assumption: The xpath will stay the same
All tweets will fit on one screen (might not happen) might have to scroll the element into view [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3401343/scroll-element-into-view-with-selenium)
Let's assume a tweet is max 800 pixels high (crumbs tweet with picture is 788 px high).
The header is 53 px high, the footer is 224 px, so in total we need to keep 277 px of extra space

"A dictionary with the size and location of the element." <- from the documentation of WebElement.rect
WHAT ARE THOSE PROPERTIES CALLED!! I DONT WANT TO HAVE TO USE TRIAL AND ERROR!!
